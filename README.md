mastermind-15c
==============

A clone of Mastermind for the HP 15c scientific calculator. Inspired by http://www.fatpat.com/software/personal/hp15c/mastermind.htm but coded from scratch.

Features:
* guess history
* fancy display
* failure state
* efficient shuffle

It uses 196 bytes for program storage and up to 20 memory registers (140 bytes). The HP 15c has 448 bytes of total memory.

A Vim syntax file is also included if you wish to edit the thing.
